# Playbook Engineering Test

This repository contains the code for the Playbook Engineering Test. It is a React application built with TypeScript and MobX, using styled-components for styling.

## Technologies Used

The main technologies used in this project are:

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- **MobX**: A state management library that makes it simple to manage application state.
- **styled-components**: A CSS-in-JS library that allows you to write CSS code within your JavaScript components.

## Dependencies

The key project's dependencies are:

- `react`
- `mobx` and `mobx-react-lite`: MobX and its React integration for state management.
- `styled-components`: The library for writing CSS-in-JS styles.
- `typescript`: The TypeScript compiler.
- `uuid`: A library for generating UUIDs (Universally Unique Identifiers).

## Improvements for future

Some of the most wanted improvements are as follows:
- Test components/functions using Jest/React Testing Library
- Proper form handler (React Hook Form, Formik, Yup)
- Add some color to the expense form :)
- Integrate with API to download current exchange rate (allow for multiple currencies)
